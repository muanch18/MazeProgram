# MazeProgram

## Description
Created in September 2019. The Maze Program features Object Oriented Programming in Java to create a maze with special specifications such as hidden treasures and walls. 
The 3D perspective is created using equations that have the x and y coordinates as parameters to constantly adjust the view as the user moves through the maze.
